# Rare-disease workflow

*This repo contain all source codes and descriptions for TTR disease analysis*

Download gene-disease association(GDA) from public database using API or from the website directly.

###  1) DisGeNET database (including Orphanet)

   DisGeNET database contains multiple public database, and we use API (UMLS CUI:C2751492,disease_name:'AMYLOIDOSIS, HEREDITARY, TRANSTHYRETIN-RELATED') to download GDAs. 74 genes are extracted from this database.
   At finally, we get 74 genes (HGNC format) from DisGeNET.

### 2) OMIM database

   This database aren`t free. Only available for website research. TTR gene was extracted.

### 3) KEGG database

   KEGG have multiple subdatabases. We use pathway (no result) and disease (family amyloidosis) database for GDAs research. 5 genes were extracted from KEGG disease database.

| Gene symbols | Gene symbols | Gene symbols | Gene symbols | Gene symbols |
| :----------: | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | :----------: |
|     TTR      | FGA          | APOA1        | LYZ          |     B2M      |

### 4) DECIPHER

â€‹    No API available for this database.There are no feedback for transthtretin amyloidsis.

### 5) PheGenI

   You should input the phenotype (mainly from mayo clinic and ICD-10) of disease. 14 genes were extracted from PheGenI trait.

### 6) Enrichr database

   This database are curated for
